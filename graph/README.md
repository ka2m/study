graph
=====

4st term Ogneva's "Graph Theory" practice course.

This directory contains `graphfau` module to interact with any type of graphs (directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted).

Also, a lot of tasks, which I have implemented. Each task has description in the beginning of the file.

For task6 you need to install `pygame` library.

#Contents

* Task 1a.15 Find out if two vertices has one common neighbor
* Task 1a.9 Get all out-connected vertices for the vertice
* Task 1b.9 Return copy of graph with deleted even vertices
* Task 2.II.11 Calculate circuit rank
* Task 2.II.20 Check if graph is forest, tree or not
* Task 2.II.30 Get shortest path in 0-1 graph
* Task 3.b Implement Boruvka's algorithm
* Task 4.20a Get number of shortest paths from some vertex to all the others (Djikstra)
* Task 4.9b Get connection LENGTHS between all the vertices (negative edges, Floyd)
* Task 4.17c Get CONNECTIONS between all the vertices (negative circuits, Ford-Bellman)
*  Task 5 Edmonds-Karp algorithm: max flow in the network
*  Task 6. This script draws first 50 friends of yours in a undirected, not weighted graph and builds friendship relationship between them with help of edges. You can click on any friend of yours, select it and the select the other one to find minimal "path" between you two.
