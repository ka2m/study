General
=======

In this repo you can find tasks, which I wrote during 1st, 2nd, 3rd semester of Algorithms and Data Structures and Functional and Logic Programming courses.

It is:

* Some tasks from Ognevaâ€™s C++ course in C++
* Some tasks on basic Data Structures: BST, Stack, List, Queue, AVLTree in Java
* Tasks in sorting, hash tables, graphs, Z-funcs in Python
* Mironov's FP course: SML, Haskell, LISP, Prolog
